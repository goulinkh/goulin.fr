Being good at coding and knowing more about one discipline in tech led me to think that I need to dive deeper into what Iâ€™m good at, learning complex stuff at a good pace.

The type of work that I do currently is mainly around web development and deployment. Because of some circumstances, Iâ€™ve been thinking of transitioning into a more technical role which involves more computer science paradigms, things like: distributed systems, containerization (at a low level) and languages such as C, Golang and Rust.

After thinking about this decision for a while during my 50+ km bike rides, where Iâ€™m in the least stressed possible state and able to think clearly, I came up with a few conclusions:

## Being good at something doesnâ€™t mean I need to try to be better

Although that may sound strange, I believe that if I'm skilled at coding, I don't necessarily need to strive to learn other programming languages and frameworks. Instead, I might need to focus on solving problems or just building cool stuff that I feel can be useful. This way, I can start producing using my current knowledge and skills, which will also _hopefully_ lead me to learn new things along the way.

## Focusing on the big picture

While working on a project, I will most likely learn about UI/UX. If other people are engaged in the project (which should be the case), I will also learn about project management and productive team communication, among other things.

That's, in my opinion, isÂ far more valuable than only focusing on my coding skills.

## Web development is a fascinating discipline

As the internet helped humanity to connect more and even give freedom to people in some societies where itâ€™s impossible to express opinions openly, on the virtual world (the internet), this became possible to some extent.

Another advantage of the internet is the possibility to use an app without the need to install it on our computers ðŸ˜€, which in the current state of the web, gives an almost perfect platform to web developers to build very cool and usefulÂ things, whether itâ€™s about building more privacy-friendly alternatives,Â focusing on making the web more accessible or simply building cool new experimental things.

## Conclusion

Sometimes trying to level up isnâ€™t as intuitive as we think it is. In my case, at first I thought that in order to get better as a developer, I needed to focus more on code and start working on more complex projects.

Although that could work for other people, for me, someone who cares about the user experience when using an operating system, testing out new products and even trying to understand that even though the Starbucks logo isnâ€™t related to coffee or the brand name by any means (a mermaid), the logo is that popular. Anyway, on the other hand, I also care about making my code more performant, more readable and all the other stuff that developers care about.

<TLDR /> So I set a goal for myself: I need to focus on building more, aiming
for polished web experiences, and connecting with people around the problems I'm
passionate about solving, and **not be afraid to let go** of things that
negatively impact me, or else I'll burn out quickly and fall off the path I'm
trying to follow.

Kudos to Robin's blog ["Building an Anchor"](https://robinwinslow.uk/build-an-anchor), where his thoughts are specific to his case, but the attitude of having goals as a compass is applicable for most people.
