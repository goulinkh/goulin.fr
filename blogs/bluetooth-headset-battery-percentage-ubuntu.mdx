## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This solution worked for me on Ubuntu 22.04. Follow this guide carefully as it could break the Bluetooth on your system.

## Solution

1. Edit the following file as root: `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`
2. Add `Experimental=true` at the beginning of the file. It should look like this:

```conf
[General]
Experimental=true
```

3. Save the file and quit the editor
4. Install this GNOME extension: https://extensions.gnome.org//extension/3991/bluetooth-battery/
5. Edit the settings so they look like this, especially the `% Source` column: ![](/assets/blogs/images/image3-1.png)
