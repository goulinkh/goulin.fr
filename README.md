## Goulin.fr

This is the 3rd iteration of my personal website, during my journey I learnt different technologies:

1. V1: Basic website with simple HTML, CSS & vanilla JS
2. V2: A demo after learning GatsbyJS
3. V3: Built with Nextjs and deployed on Vercel (lazy to setup a CD pipeline)

**Warning** : The current version has a lot of spaghetti code, I will clean it up gradually.
